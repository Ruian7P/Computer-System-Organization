## String and Character
### Character: '', not terminate with '\0'. 'n'
### String: "", terminate with '\0'. **a array of character**. "name"
- char name[10] ={'n','a','m','e'}
- char str[] = "name"     ==     char str[5] = "name"

[important!]
- char s[10] = "hello" 
  - create String "hello", **copy** the characters in "hello" into the array, fill the left char with '\0'
- char *c = "hello"
  - create String "hello" (in **read-only** data memory), give the address of first character of "hello" to pointer c
- character in s is changeable, but character in c is not (since read only)
